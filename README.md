# fibonacci
### Apprenticeship development

Fibonacci allows the user to input either an integer through the terminal, or a file with integers. These integers are then converted to their Fibonacci numbers and the results are printed to the terminal. If an output file is specified, then the output will also be appended to this file. To run the program, use the following command:

go run program/* -inputFile=input.txt -outputFile=output.txt
